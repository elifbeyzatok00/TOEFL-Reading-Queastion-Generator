"PASSAGE EXCERPT: “The United States in the 1800s was full of practical, hardworking 
people who did not consider the arts—from theater to painting—useful occupations. 
In addition, the public’s attitude that European art was better than American art both 
discouraged and infuriated American artists. In the early 1900s there was a strong feeling 
among artists that the United States was long overdue in developing art that did not 
reproduce European traditions. Everybody agreed that the heart and soul of the new country 
should be reflected in its art. But opinions differed about what this art would be like and how 
it would develop.” 
According to paragraph 1, all of the following were true of American art in the late 1800s 
and early 1900s EXCEPT: 
A Most Americans thought art was unimportant. 
B American art generally copied European styles and traditions. 
C Most Americans considered American art inferior to European art. 
D American art was very popular with European audiences.";Negative Factual Information Question
" PASSAGE EXCERPT: “. . . The nineteenth century brought with it a burst of new discoveries 
and inventions that revolutionized the candle industry and made lighting available to all. 
In the early-to-mid-nineteenth century, a process was developed to refine tallow (fat from 
animals) with alkali and sulfuric acid. The result was a product called stearin. Stearin is harder 
and burns longer than unrefined tallow. This breakthrough meant that it was possible to 
make tallow candles that would not produce the usual smoke and rancid odor. Stearins were 
also derived from palm oils, so vegetable waxes as well as animal fats could be used to make 
candles . . . ” 
Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about candles before the nine

A They did not smoke when they were burned. 
B They produced a pleasant odor as they burned.

only limited in terms of the materials used to make them. Sculptures must, for example,

" PASSAGE EXCERPT: “. . . Although we now tend to refer to the various crafts according to 
the materials used to construct them—clay, glass, wood, fiber, and metal—it was once

into simple categories: containers, shelters, and supports. There is no way around the fact 
that containers, shelters, and supports must be functional. The applied arts are thus bound 
by the laws of physics, which pertain to both the materials used in their making and the

APPLIED ARTS AND FINE ARTS 
Although we now tend to refer to the various crafts according to the materials used to con
struct them—clay, glass, wood, fiber, and metal—it was once common to think of crafts in 
terms of function, which led to their being known as the “applied arts.” Approaching crafts 
from the point of view of function, we can divide them into simple categories: containers, 
shelters, and supports. There is no way around the fact that containers, shelters, and sup
ports must be functional. The applied arts are thus bound by the laws of physics, which 
pertain to both the materials used in their making and the substances and things to be 
contained, supported, and sheltered. These laws are universal in their application, regard
less of cultural beliefs, geography, or climate. If a pot has no bottom or has large openings 
in its sides, it could hardly be considered a container in any traditional sense. Since the laws 
of physics, not some arbitrary decision, have determined the general form of applied-art 
objects, they follow basic patterns, so much so that functional forms can vary only within 
certain limits. Buildings without roofs, for example, are unusual because they depart from 
the norm. However, not all functional objects are exactly alike; that is why we recognize a 
Shang Dynasty vase as being different from an Inca vase. What varies is not the basic form 
but the incidental details that do not obstruct the object’s primary function. 
Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the maker of applied
art objects. It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the maker of fine-art objects. 
This assumption misses a significant difference between the two disciplines. Fine-art objects 
are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied-art objects are. 
Because their primary purpose is not functional, they are only limited in terms of the mate
rials used to make them. Sculptures must, for example, be stable, which requires an under
standing of the properties of mass, weight distribution, and stress. Paintings must have rigid 
stretchers so that the canvas will be taut, and the paint must not deteriorate, crack, or dis
color. These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude 
upon his or her conception of the work. For example, in the early Italian Renaissance, 
bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg. In other 
words, the demands of the laws of physics, not the sculptor’s aesthetic intentions, placed  
the ball there. That this device was a necessary structural compromise is clear from the fact 
that the cannonball quickly disappeared when sculptors learned how to strengthen the 
internal structure of a statue with iron braces (iron being much stronger than bronze). 
Even though the fine arts in the twentieth century often treat materials in new ways, 
the basic difference in attitude of artists in relation to their materials in the fine arts and 
the applied arts remains relatively constant. It would therefore not be too great an exag
geration to say that practitioners of the fine arts work to overcome the limitations of their 
materials, whereas those engaged in the applied arts work in concert with their materials.
